        <p>
            One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must.

        <h2> Inredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
        </ol>
