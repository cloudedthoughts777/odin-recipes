        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The best thick hearty chili recipe you'll ever need. In 25 years of restaurant cooking, this is my classic chili recipe; loved by thousands. Vary the amount of green chilies and hot sauce if you're an Easterner unused to fiery Western foods, but don't change anything else.


        </p>
        <h2> Inredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dried pinto beans</li>
            <li>1 pound 90%-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 large sweet onions, diced</li>
            <li>3 cups diced celery</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pinto beans in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. </li>
            <li>Cook and stir beef in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease from pot.</li>
